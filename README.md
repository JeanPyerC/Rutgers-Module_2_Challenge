# MODULE_2_CHALLENGE
This is a Module 2 challenge, focusing on VBA on stocks from 2017 to 2018.
## Overview of Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purpose of this project is to understand VBA programming. To understand the basic structure of creating arrays, creating loops, and reading/storing the values for each specific task.  It’s a different language, but this can help in the future. Imagine someone who doesn’t know nothing about excel needs a specific report. Instead of having one person writing a formula over and over again, you can be the hero and say, “Hey I can create a macro where it can automatically run the formula with a click of a button.” That my friend, is what we did. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By viewing the data within the year of 2017, you can see our return percentage has amazing results. If you look within the materials, Ticker SPWR has the highest daily volume with a return percent of 23.1. Ticker DQ has the lowest daily volume with a Return percent of 199.4%. This idea can tell story, however, not a good one as other Tickers has similar daily volume, but the percent does not come close.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By viewing the data within the year of 2018, you can see our average return percentage is negative 8.5. Tickers ENPH and RUN are the only tickers with positive return percentage. Ticker AY has the lowest daily volume with a return percent of negative 7.3.
